# 3DSnap
3D Snapchats. We wanted to build something cool, something that involved a 3DS. Not your typical hackathon hack, right? <br>
**4 webservers.** One in PHP. one in Node.JS. and two more in Flask, because why not. <br>
**2 clients.** Mobile (iOS/Android) and 3DS.

### challenges
 - running custom code on a 3DS
 - taking pictures with a 3DS and using HTTP POST to transfer it across the web
 - receiving pictures with a 3DS and rendering them in 3D without giving the user a headache
 - taking stereoscopic 3D images with a smartphone that only has one camera
 - rendering such images on a smartphone and crafting a 3D appearance

### the process:
1. hack 3DS and do tons of reverse engineering, evil bit hacks and guessing to interface with 3DS hardware
2. figure out how to take _stereoscopic_ 3D images - with iPhones, Android phones, and the 3DS.
3. render 3D stuff everywhere.
4. and you have...
